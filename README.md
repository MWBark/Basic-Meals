# Basic Meals

Basic Meals is a website that aims, as the site name suggests, to provide the user recipes of basic meals that include ingredients that are both affordable and accessible and recipes that are easy to cook.

Users will find the information they need in the home page 'What are we about?' board, the recipes page and the sign up page. The website is aimed at people who are cooking on a budget and want meals that are easy to make. This will most likely be parents with a family to cook for, which is why the amount of ingredients is aimed at 4 servings.
